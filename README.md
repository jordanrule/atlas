This is a playground for testing empirical properties of the Paxos consensus algorithm against the Raft consensus algorithm in Go.  Paxos implementation care of [Richard Knop](https://github.com/RichardKnop), Raft implementation care of [Piotr Tabor](https://github.com/ptabor).  More details to come as I become familiar with the properties of each and where we might expect significant divergence.

Note original licenses remain intact for the bodies of work the algorithms have been extracted from.
